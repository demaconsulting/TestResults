# AI Instructions for TestResults

This file provides specific context and instructions for AI coding agents to
interact effectively with this C# project.


## Project Overview

TestResults is a C# library for creating TRX test result files.


## Technologies and Dependencies

* **Language**: C# 12
* **.NET Frameworks**: .NET 8, 9, and 10
* **Primary Dependencies**: None


## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* `/.config/`: Contains the .NET Tool configuration.
* `/.github/workflows/`: Contains the CI/CD pipeline configurations.
* `/src/DemaConsulting.TestResults/`: Contains the library source code.
* `/test/DemaConsulting.TestResults.Tests/`: Contains the library unit tests.
* `/DemaConsulting.TestResults.sln`: The main Visual Studio solution file.


## Development Commands

Use these commands to perform common development tasks:

* **Restore DotNet Tools**:
  ```bash
  dotnet tool restore
  ```

* **Build the Project**:
  ```bash
  dotnet build
  ```

* **Run All Tests**:
  ```bash
  dotnet test
  ```


## Testing Guidelines

* Tests are located under the `/test/DemaConsulting.TestResults.Tests/` folder and use the MSTest framework.
* Test files should end with `.cs` and adhere to the naming convention `[Component]Tests.cs`.
* All new features should be tested with comprehensive unit tests.
* The build must pass all tests and static analysis warnings before merging.
* Tests should be written using the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern.


## Code Style and Conventions

* Follow standard C# naming conventions (PascalCase for classes/methods/properties, camelCase for local variables).
* Nullable reference types are enabled at the project level (`<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` in .csproj files). Do not use file-level `#nullable enable` directives.
* Warnings are treated as errors (`<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>`).
* Avoid public fields; prefer properties.


## Boundaries and Guardrails

* **NEVER** modify files within the `/obj/` or `/bin/` directories.
* **NEVER** commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive configuration data.
* **ASK FIRST** before making significant architectural changes to the core library logic.
